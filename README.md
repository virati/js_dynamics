# JS Dynamics Viewer

A viewer to see animated versions of dynamics (and soon "control", whatever that looks like).


## Built from "Instanced Line Rendering" demo
----------------------------

This is the source for the demos in my blog post [Instanced Line Rendering](https://wwwtyro.net/2019/11/18/instanced-lines.html).

To build the demos:

```sh
$ npm i
$ npm run build
```

To view the demos, open `docs/index.html` in your browser.
